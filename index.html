    <p><h1>About Me</h1></p>
     <img src="img/engagement_pic.jpg" alt="Rose and I at Harris Beach, OR." width="300" height="300" align="middle" />
    <p>I was born May 5<sup>th</sup>, 1990 in Medford, OR. I moved to Saratoga Springs, UT where I met my wife, Rose. We were married May 25<sup>th</sup> 2014. We currently have no kids but we do have 3 adopted dogs (which are pretty much our kids!). We moved to Washington in 2014 and we are currently living in Seattle.</p>
    <p> I graduated high school with a diploma in 2008. Until enrolling in Code Fellows, I have not attended any other schools. My background consists of most recently plumbing. I worked as a plumber until (date), when I was laid off. A perfect time to enroll at Code Fellows!</p>
    <p> My interests are primarily outdoor activities such as hiking, camping, gold prospecting, walking my dogs. I also enjoy relaxing at home and watching a good movie while sipping some hot chocolate.</p>
